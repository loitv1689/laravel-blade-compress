# laravel-blade-compress
compress html when blade being compiled into php file

Unlike the [laravel-html-minify](the https://github.com/fitztrev/laravel-html-minify/wiki/Laravel-5---5.1-HTML-Minifying) project, which use `gulp-htmlmin` to watch laravel runtime compiled templates under `/storage/framework/views` directory.
This incursive code will compress html at compile time, benifit form the laravel 'view cache' feature, you won't pay extra overhead for compress html on the fly.

+ ps: laravel view module compare the last-modified-time of *.blade.php with the last-modified-time of compiled target files to determine whether a view cache is expired. The target file's name is generated by MD5 the path of the original file.
